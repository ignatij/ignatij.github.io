# Dependency Management Metrics Maven Plugin

A powerful Maven plugin that computes Dependency Management Metrics for multi-module Java projects, helping developers maintain clean architecture principles and identify architectural violations.

## Overview

The Dependency Management Metrics Maven Plugin is designed to analyze and enforce clean architecture principles in Java projects. It calculates key metrics based on Robert C. Martin's Clean Architecture principles, helping teams maintain high-quality, maintainable codebases.

## Key Features

- **Stability Metric**: Measures how resistant a component is to change
- **Abstraction Metric**: Evaluates the level of abstraction in components
- **Distance from Main Sequence**: Calculates how far components deviate from ideal architecture
- **Zone Analysis**: Identifies components in "Zone of Pain" and "Zone of Uselessness"
- **Build Integration**: Can break builds when architectural principles are violated
- **Multi-module Support**: Analyzes complex multi-module Maven projects
- **Configurable Output**: Customizable report generation and output locations

## Technical Architecture

### Core Metrics

- **Stability (S)**: Ratio of outgoing dependencies to total dependencies
- **Abstraction (A)**: Ratio of abstract classes and interfaces to total classes
- **Distance from Main Sequence (D)**: How far a component is from the ideal A + S = 1 line

### Architectural Principles

- **Stable Dependencies Principle**: Dependencies should point toward stability
- **Stable Abstractions Principle**: The more stable a component is, the more abstract it should be

## Implementation Highlights

### Basic Plugin Configuration

```xml
<build>
  <pluginManagement>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.github.ignatij</groupId>
        <artifactId>dependency-management-metrics-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.17</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </pluginManagement>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.github.ignatij</groupId>
      <artifactId>dependency-management-metrics-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <inherited>false</inherited>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <phase>verify</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>check</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

### Build Failure Configuration

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.github.ignatij</groupId>
    <artifactId>dependency-management-metrics-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.17</version>
    <configuration>
        <failOnViolation>true</failOnViolation>
    </configuration>
    <inherited>false</inherited>
</plugin>
```

### Custom Output Configuration

```xml
<configuration>
    <output.file>custom-metrics-report.txt</output.file>
</configuration>
```

## Real-World Applications

### Enterprise Java Projects

The plugin is particularly valuable for:

- **Large Multi-module Projects**: Analyzing complex dependency structures
- **Microservices Architecture**: Ensuring proper service boundaries
- **Legacy Code Modernization**: Identifying architectural debt
- **Code Review Process**: Automated architectural compliance checks
- **CI/CD Integration**: Preventing architectural violations in builds

### Common Use Cases

- **Dependency Analysis**: Understanding component coupling and cohesion
- **Architecture Validation**: Ensuring adherence to clean architecture principles
- **Refactoring Guidance**: Identifying components that need architectural improvements
- **Team Education**: Teaching developers about clean architecture concepts

## Plugin Goals

### Available Goals

- **check**: Analyzes the project and generates metrics report
- **report**: Generates detailed metrics report without build integration

### Execution Phases

- **verify**: Runs during the verify phase by default
- **compile**: Can be configured to run earlier in the build lifecycle
- **test**: Alternative phase for integration with testing

## Output Analysis

### Metrics Report

The plugin generates comprehensive reports including:

- **Component Metrics**: Individual stability and abstraction values
- **Zone Classification**: Components in exclusion zones
- **Violation Detection**: Breaches of architectural principles
- **Recommendations**: Suggested improvements for problematic components

### Zone of Exclusions

- **Zone of Pain**: High stability, low abstraction (difficult to test)
- **Zone of Uselessness**: Low stability, high abstraction (unnecessary complexity)

## Theoretical Foundation

### Clean Architecture Principles

The plugin is based on Robert C. Martin's Clean Architecture principles:

- **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies should point inward toward higher-level policies
- **Stability**: Components should be stable in the direction of change
- **Abstraction**: Stable components should be abstract

### Metrics Calculation

- **Stability (S)**: Ce / (Ce + Ca) where Ce = efferent couplings, Ca = afferent couplings
- **Abstraction (A)**: Na / Nc where Na = abstract classes, Nc = total classes
- **Distance (D)**: |A + S - 1| / âˆš2
