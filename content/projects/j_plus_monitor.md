# J+ Monitor

A rule-based website monitoring platform that enables users to create custom monitoring rules for targeting websites and automatically generates real-time events and overview data.

## Overview

J+ Monitor allows users to define custom rules for checking specific aspects of target websites. The platform automatically executes these rules and generates events with detailed overview data, providing insights into website performance, content changes, and user-defined metrics.

## Key Features

* **Custom Rule Creation**: Intuitive interface for defining monitoring rules for target websites
* **Event Generation**: Automated creation of events based on rule violations or conditions
* **Real-time Overview Data**: Comprehensive analytics and insights for each monitored website
* **Performance Optimization**: 33% speed improvement through Golang migration

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Infrastructure

* **Microservices Architecture**: Scalable, maintainable service-oriented design with event-driven architecture
* **Event-Driven Processing**: Google Pub/Sub integration for reliable event handling
* **Rule Engine**: High-performance rule processing and execution system

### Frontend Technologies

* **React**: Modern, responsive user interface for rule creation and data visualization
* **Interactive Dashboards**: Real-time overview data and event visualization
* **Rule Builder Interface**: User-friendly tools for creating and managing monitoring rules

## Performance Improvements

### Golang Migration

* **Rule Processing Engine**: Migrated rule execution logic from Node.js to Golang
* **33% Performance Boost**: Significant improvement in rule processing speed
* **Reduced Resource Usage**: Drastically reduced memory and CPU footprint
* **Enhanced Concurrency**: Better handling of multiple simultaneous website checks

### Architecture Migration

* **From Synchronous to Event-Driven**: Migrated from REST-based microservices communication to event-driven architecture
* **Google Pub/Sub Integration**: Replaced direct HTTP calls with asynchronous message processing
* **Improved Scalability**: Event-driven design enables better handling of high-volume monitoring requests

## My Role

* **Golang Migration**: Led the migration of one Node.js microservice to Golang
* **Monitoring Tool Development**: Built the core website monitoring tool in Golang, achieving 33% performance improvement
* **Architecture Design**: Designed and implemented the rule-based monitoring architecture
* **Event System**: Developed the event generation and overview data system

## Impact & Results

* **33% Performance Improvement**: Enhanced rule processing speed through Golang migration
* **Reduced Resource Usage**: Drastically reduced memory and CPU footprint
* **Scalable Monitoring**: Successfully handles thousands of concurrent website checks
* **Automated Event Generation**: Reduced manual monitoring effort by 90%
