# RNE - Rail Network Europe

A sophisticated system for overseeing rail operations across 15 European countries, providing comprehensive monitoring, management, and coordination capabilities for European rail networks.

## Overview

RNE (Rail Network Europe) was a complex, multi-country rail operations system that required handling diverse rail networks, regulations, and operational requirements across 15 European countries. The system provided comprehensive monitoring, coordination, and management capabilities for European rail operations.

## Key Features

* **Multi-Country Operations**: Oversight system covering 15 European countries
* **Rail Operations Monitoring**: Comprehensive tracking and monitoring of rail operations
* **Cross-Border Coordination**: Seamless coordination between different European rail networks

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Infrastructure

* **Java & Spring**: Robust backend services for rail operations management
* **GraphQL API**: Flexible data querying

### Frontend Technologies

* **Angular**: Modern frontend framework for rail operations dashboard
* **TypeScript**: Type-safe development for complex rail operations logic
* **NgRx State Management**: Advanced state management
* **GraphQL Integration**: Efficient data fetching

## Technical Challenges

### Timezone Management

* **Multi-Country Timezones**: Coordinated operations across 15 different European timezones
* **Timezone Synchronization**: Ensured accurate time-based operations across borders
* **Schedule Coordination**: Managed train schedules and operations in multiple timezones
* **Data Consistency**: Maintained consistent timestamps across diverse rail networks

## My Role

* **Full-Stack Development**: Developed both backend (Java/Spring) and frontend (Angular) components
* **GraphQL Implementation**: Built flexible APIs for rail operations data
* **State Management**: Implemented NgRx for complex state management
* **Career Growth**: Progressed from junior to senior developer role over 4+ years

## Impact & Results

* **European Rail Coordination**: Successfully coordinated rail operations across 15 countries
* **Rail Operations Monitoring**: Provided comprehensive oversight of European rail networks
* **Career Advancement**: Demonstrated growth from junior to senior developer
