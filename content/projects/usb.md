# USB

A comprehensive project focused on creating and maintaining multiple applications for a hospital in Basel, Switzerland, with unified frontend architecture and standardized authentication.

## Overview

USB was a foundational project for a hospital in Basel that unified the frontend of multiple applications using a shared Angular component library. The project also included creating Java common libraries for authentication and authorization, along with third-party API service integration.

## Key Features

* **Unified Frontend**: Standardized Angular component library across all hospital applications
* **Authentication Libraries**: Java common libraries for authentication and authorization
* **Third-Party Integration**: Integrated external API services for hospital operations

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Infrastructure

* **Java & Spring**: Robust backend services with common authentication libraries
* **Authentication Libraries**: Reusable Java libraries for authentication and authorization
* **Third-Party API Integration**: External service integration for hospital operations
* **API Standardization**: Consistent interfaces for external service communication

### Frontend Technologies

* **Angular Component Library**: Unified UI components shared across all applications using PrimeNG
* **TypeScript**: Type-safe development for improved code quality
* **Shared Design System**: Consistent design components across hospital applications
* **Cross-Application Integration**: Seamless integration between multiple hospital applications

## Team Management
